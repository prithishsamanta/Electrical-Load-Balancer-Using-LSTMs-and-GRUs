The demand for energy has sharply increased recently all around the world. In
recent years, there has been a sharp rise in electricity use. The amount of
electricity used is increasing as technology advances on a daily basis. The amount
of electricity utilized in agricultural areas is rising along with it, making it
difficult for farmers to keep up with the rising demand for electricity. The amount
of electricity needed varies depending on the weather on any given day, making it
difficult to forecast the amount that would be needed in the near future. In this
study, we sought to use recurrent neural networks to overcome this issue. Over the
past few months we have tried to build an AI model that can perform load
balancing on a time series data. The time series data contains 5 years worth of
data on the electricity demands of the farms. This data, LSTM, and GRU have all
been used to try and address this issue. Deep learning algorithms that forecast
future load requirements have been created. Additionally, we evaluated the
effectiveness of the new models in comparison to the previous study's outdated
models."# Electrical-Load-Balancer-Using-LSTMs-and-GRUs"
